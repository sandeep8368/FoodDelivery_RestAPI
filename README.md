# FoodDelivery_RestAPI

The Food Delivery System is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of ordering food online. It allows customers to browse a list of available food items, place orders, and manage their order history. Admin users can manage menu items, view all orders, and track customer details.

This project mimics real-world online food delivery platforms like Swiggy or Zomato, offering a user-friendly interface and backend APIs to handle all operations efficiently.
